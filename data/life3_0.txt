A low-tech way to build a partial Dyson sphere is to place a ring of habitats in circular orbit around the Sun. 

To completely surround the Sun, you could add rings orbiting it around different axes at slightly different distances, to avoid collisions. 

To avoid the nuisance that these fast-moving rings couldn’t be connected to one another, complicating transportation and communication, one could instead build a monolithic stationary Dyson sphere where the Sun’s inward gravitational pull is balanced by the outward pressure from the Sun’s radiation— an idea pioneered by Robert L. Forward and by Colin McInnes. 

The sphere can be built by gradually adding more “statites”: stationary satellites that counteract the Sun’s gravity with radiation pressure rather than centrifugal forces. 

Both of these forces drop off with the square of the distance to the Sun, which means that if they can be balanced at one distance from the Sun, they’ll conveniently be balanced at any other distance as well, allowing freedom to park anywhere in our Solar System. 

Statites need to be extremely lightweight sheets, weighing only 0.77 grams per square meter, which is about 100 times less than paper, but this is unlikely to be a showstopper

If the Dyson sphere is built to reflect rather than absorb most of the sunlight, then the total intensity of light bouncing around within it will be dramatically increased, further boosting the radiation pressure and the amount of mass that can be supported in the sphere. 

Many other stars have a thousandfold and even a millionfold greater luminosity than our Sun, and are therefore able to support correspondingly heavier stationary Dyson spheres. 

For today’s humans, life on or in a Dyson sphere would at best be disorienting and at worst impossible, but that need not stop future biological or nonbiological life forms from thriving there.
