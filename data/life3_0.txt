A low-tech way to build a partial Dyson sphere is to place a ring of habitats in circular orbit around the Sun. 

To completely surround the Sun, you could add rings orbiting it around different axes at slightly different distances, to avoid collisions. 

To avoid the nuisance that these fast-moving rings couldn’t be connected to one another, complicating transportation and communication, one could instead build a monolithic stationary Dyson sphere where the Sun’s inward gravitational pull is balanced by the outward pressure from the Sun’s radiation— an idea pioneered by Robert L. Forward and by Colin McInnes. 

The sphere can be built by gradually adding more “statites”: stationary satellites that counteract the Sun’s gravity with radiation pressure rather than centrifugal forces. 

Both of these forces drop off with the square of the distance to the Sun, which means that if they can be balanced at one distance from the Sun, they’ll conveniently be balanced at any other distance as well, allowing freedom to park anywhere in our Solar System. 

Statites need to be extremely lightweight sheets, weighing only 0.77 grams per square meter, which is about 100 times less than paper, but this is unlikely to be a showstopper

If the Dyson sphere is built to reflect rather than absorb most of the sunlight, then the total intensity of light bouncing around within it will be dramatically increased, further boosting the radiation pressure and the amount of mass that can be supported in the sphere. 

Many other stars have a thousandfold and even a millionfold greater luminosity than our Sun, and are therefore able to support correspondingly heavier stationary Dyson spheres. 

For today’s humans, life on or in a Dyson sphere would at best be disorienting and at worst impossible, but that need not stop future biological or nonbiological life forms from thriving there. 

A problem with using black hole evaporation as a power source is that, unless the black hole is much smaller than an atom in size, it’s an excruciatingly slow process that takes longer than the present age of our Universe and radiates less energy than a candle. 

The power produced decreases with the square of the size of the hole, and the physicists Louis Crane and Shawn Westmoreland have therefore proposed using a black hole about a thousand times smaller than a proton, weighing about as much as the largest-ever seagoing ship. 

Their main motivation was to use the black hole engine to power a starship (a topic to which we return below), so they were more concerned with portability than efficiency and proposed feeding the black hole with laser light, causing no energy-to-matter conversion at all. 

Even if you could feed it with matter instead of radiation, guaranteeing high efficiency appears difficult: to make protons enter such a black hole a thousandth their size, they would have to be fired at the hole with a machine as powerful as the Large Hadron Collider, augmenting their energy mc2 with at least a thousand times more kinetic (motion) energy. 

Since at least 10% of that kinetic energy would be lost to gravitons when the black hole evaporates, we’d therefore be putting more energy into the black hole than we’d be able to extract and put to work, ending up with negative efficiency. 

Fortunately, there are other ways of using black holes as power plants that don’t involve quantum gravity or other poorly understood physics. For example, many existing black holes spin very fast, with their event horizons whirling around near the speed of light, and this rotation energy can be extracted. 

The event horizon of a black hole is the region from which not even light can escape, because the gravitational pull is too powerful. 

f you toss an object into the ergosphere, it will therefore pick up speed rotating around the hole. Unfortunately, it will soon get eaten up by the black hole, forever disappearing through the event horizon, so this does you no good if you’re trying to extract energy. However, Roger Penrose discovered that if you launch the object at a clever angle and make it split into two pieces as figure 6.4 illustrates, then you can arrange for only one piece to get eaten while the other escapes the black hole with more energy than you started with. In other words, you’ve successfully converted some of the rotational energy of the black hole into useful energy that you can put to work. By repeating this process many times, you can milk the black hole of all its rotational energy so that it stops spinning and its ergosphere disappears. 

Another interesting strategy is to extract energy not from the black hole itself, but from matter falling into it. Nature has already found a way of doing this all on its own: the quasar. As gas swirls even closer to a black hole, forming a pizza-shaped disk whose innermost parts gradually get gobbled up, it gets extremely hot and gives off copious amounts of radiation. As gas falls downward toward the hole, it speeds up, converting its gravitational potential energy into motion energy, just as a skydiver does. The motion gets progressively messier as complicated turbulence converts the coordinated motion of the gas blob into random motion on ever-smaller scales, until individual atoms begin colliding with each other at high speeds—having such random motion is precisely what it means to be hot, and these violent collisions convert motion energy into radiation. By building a Dyson sphere around the entire black hole, at a safe distance, this radiation energy can be captured and put to use. The faster the black hole spins, the more efficient this process gets, with a maximally spinning black hole delivering energy at a whopping 42% efficiency. *4 For black holes weighing about as much as a star, most of the energy comes out as X-rays, whereas for the supermassive kind found in the centers of galaxies, much of it emerges somewhere in the range of infrared, visible and ultraviolet light. 

There is another known way to convert matter into energy that doesn’t involve black holes at all: the sphaleron process. It can destroy quarks and turn them into leptons: electrons, their heavier cousins the muon and tau particles, neutrinos or their antiparticles. 4 As illustrated in figure 6.5, the standard model of particle physics predicts that nine quarks with appropriate flavor and spin can come together and transform into three leptons through an intermediate state called a sphaleron. Because the input weighs more than the output, the mass difference gets converted into energy according to Einstein’s E = mc2 formula. 

Future intelligent life might therefore be able to build what I’ll call a sphalerizer: an energy generator acting like a diesel engine on steroids. A traditional diesel engine compresses a mixture of air and diesel oil until the temperature gets high enough for it to spontaneously ignite and burn, after which the hot mixture re-expands and does useful work in the process, say pushing a piston. The carbon dioxide and other combustion gases weigh about 0.00000005% less than what was in the piston initially, and this mass difference turns into the heat energy driving the engine. A sphalerizer would compress ordinary matter to a couple of quadrillion degrees, and then let it re-expand and cool once the sphalerons had done their thing. *6 We already know the result of this experiment, because our early Universe performed it for us about 13.8 billion years ago, when it was that hot: almost 100% of the matter gets converted into energy, with less than a billionth of the particles left over being the stuff that ordinary matter is made of: quarks and electrons. So it’s just like a diesel engine, except over a billion times more efficient! Another advantage is that you don’t need to be finicky about what to fuel it with—it works with anything made of quarks, meaning any normal matter at all. 

Because of these high-temperature processes, our baby Universe produced over a trillion times more radiation (photons and neutrinos) than matter (quarks and electrons that later clumped into atoms). During the 13.8 billion years since then, a great segregation took place, where atoms became concentrated into galaxies, stars and planets, while most photons stayed in intergalactic space, forming the cosmic microwave background radiation that has been used to make baby pictures of our Universe. Any advanced life form living in a galaxy or other matter concentration can therefore turn most of its available matter back into energy, rebooting the matter percentage down to the same tiny value that emerged from our early Universe by briefly re-creating those hot dense conditions inside a sphalerizer. 

From a physics perspective, everything that future life may want to create—from habitats and machines to new life forms—is simply elementary particles arranged in some particular way. Just as a blue whale is rearranged krill and krill is rearranged plankton, our entire Solar System is simply hydrogen rearranged during 13.8 billion years of cosmic evolution: gravity rearranged hydrogen into stars which rearranged the hydrogen into heavier atoms, after which gravity rearranged such atoms into our planet where chemical and biological processes rearranged them into life. 
Future life that has reached its technological limit can perform such particle rearrangements more rapidly and efficiently, by first using its computing power to figure out the most efficient method and then using its available energy to power the matter rearrangement process. We saw how matter can be converted into both computers and energy, so it’s in a sense the only fundamental resource needed. *7 Once future life has bumped up against the physical limits on what it can do with its matter, there is only one way left for it to do more: by getting more matter. And the only way it can do this is by expanding into our Universe. Spaceward ho! 

The first challenge is that our Universe is expanding, which means that almost all galaxies are flying away from us, so settling distant galaxies amounts to a game of catch-up. The second challenge is that this cosmic expansion is accelerating, due to the mysterious dark energy that makes up about 70% of our 
Universe. To understand how this causes trouble, imagine that you enter a train platform and see your train slowly accelerating away from you, but with a door left invitingly open. If you’re fast and foolhardy, can you catch the train? Since it will eventually go faster than you can run, the answer clearly depends on how far away from you the train is initially: if it’s beyond a certain critical distance, you’ll never catch up with it. We face the same situation trying to catch those distant galaxies that are accelerating away from us: even if we could travel at the speed of light, all galaxies beyond about 17 billion light-years remain forever out of reach—and that’s over 98% of the galaxies in our Universe. 

But hold on: didn’t Einstein’s special relativity theory say that nothing can travel faster than light? So how can galaxies outrace something traveling at the speed of light? The answer is that special relativity is superseded by Einstein’s general relativity theory, where the speed limit is more liberal: nothing can travel faster than the speed of light through space, but space is free to expand as fast as it wants. Einstein also gave us a nice way of visualizing these speed limits by viewing time as the fourth dimension in spacetime (see figure 6.7, where I’ve kept things three-dimensional by omitting one of the three space dimensions). If space weren’t expanding, light rays would form slanted 45-degree lines through spacetime, so that the regions we can see and reach from here and now are cones. Whereas our past light cone would be truncated by our Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, our future light cone would expand forever, giving us access to an unlimited cosmic endowment. In contrast, the middle panel of the figure shows that an expanding universe with dark energy (which appears to be the Universe we inhabit) deforms our light cones into a champagne-glass shape, forever limiting the number of galaxies we can settle to about 10 billion. 

If this limit makes you feel cosmic claustrophobia, let me cheer you up with a possible loophole: my calculation assumes that dark energy remains constant over time, consistent with what the latest measurements suggest. However, we still have no clue what dark energy really is, which leaves a glimmer of hope that dark energy will eventually decay away (much like the similar dark-energy-like substance postulated to explain cosmic inflation), and if this happens, the acceleration will give way to deceleration, potentially enabling future life forms to keep settling new galaxies for as long as they last. 

Another popular idea is to build a rocket that need not carry its own fuel. For example, interstellar space isn’t a perfect vacuum, but contains the occasional hydrogen ion (a lone proton: a hydrogen atom that’s lost its electron). In 1960, this gave physicist Robert Bussard the idea behind what’s now known as a Bussard ramjet: to scoop up such ions en route and use them as rocket fuel in an onboard fusion reactor. Although recent work has cast doubts on whether this can be made to work in practice, there’s another carry-no-fuel idea that does appear feasible for a high-tech spacefaring civilization: laser sailing. 

The possibility of superintelligence completely transforms this picture, making it much more promising for those with intergalactic wanderlust. Removing the need to transport bulky human life-support systems and adding AI-invented technology, intergalactic settlement suddenly appears rather straightforward. Forward’s laser sailing becomes much cheaper when the spacecraft need merely be large enough to contain a “seed probe”: a robot capable of landing on an asteroid or planet in the target solar system and building up a new civilization from scratch. It doesn’t even have to carry the instructions with it: all it has to do is build a receiving antenna large enough to pick up more detailed blueprints and instructions transmitted from its mother civilization at the speed of light. Once done, it uses its newly constructed lasers to send out new seed probes to continue settling the galaxy one solar system at a time. Even the vast dark expanses of space between galaxies tend to contain a significant number of intergalactic stars (rejects once ejected from their home galaxies) that can be used as way stations, thus enabling an island-hopping strategy for intergalactic laser sailing. 

If dark energy continues to accelerate distant galaxies away from one another, as the latest experimental data suggests, then this will pose a major nuisance to the future of life. It means that even if a future civilization manages to settle a million galaxies, dark energy will over the course of tens of billions of years fragment this cosmic empire into thousands of different regions unable to communicate with one another. If future life does nothing to prevent this fragmentation, then the largest remaining bastions of life will be clusters containing about a thousand galaxies, whose combined gravity is strong enough to overpower the dark energy trying to separate them. 

If a superintelligent civilization wants to stay connected, this would give it a strong incentive to do large-scale cosmic engineering. How much matter will it have time to move into its largest supercluster before dark energy puts it forever out of reach? One method for moving a star large distances is to nudge a third star into a binary system where two stars are stably orbiting each other. Just as with romantic relationships, the introduction of a third partner can destabilize things and lead to one of the three being violently ejected—in the stellar case, at great speed. If some of the three partners are black holes, such a volatile threesome can be used to fling mass fast enough to fly far outside the host galaxy. Unfortunately, this three-body technique, applied either to stars, black holes or galaxies, doesn’t appear able to move more than a tiny fraction of a civilization’s mass the large distances required to outsmart dark energy.

If, despite its best attempts at cosmic engineering, a future civilization concludes that parts of it are doomed to drift out of contact forever, it might simply let them go and wish them well. However, if it has ambitious computing goals that involve seeking the answers to certain very difficult questions, it might instead resort to a slash-and-burn strategy: it could convert the outlying galaxies into massive computers that transform their matter and energy into computation at a frenzied pace, in the hope that before dark energy pushes their burnt-out remnants from view, they could transmit the long-sought answers back to the mother cluster. This slash-and-burn strategy would be particularly appropriate for regions so distant that they can only be reached by the “cosmic spam” method, much to the chagrin of the preexisting inhabitants. Back home in the mother region, the civilization could instead aim for maximum conservation and efficiency to last as long as possible. 

After exploring how long future life can last, let’s explore how long it might want to last. Although you might find it natural to want to live as long as possible, Freeman Dyson also gave a more quantitative argument for this desire: the cost of computation drops when you compute slowly, so you’ll ultimately get more done if you slow things down as much as possible. Freeman even calculated that if our Universe keeps expanding and cooling forever, an infinite amount of computation might be possible. 
Slow doesn’t necessarily mean boring: if future life lives in a simulated world, its subjectively experienced flow of time need not have anything to do with the glacial pace at which the simulation is being run in the outside world, so the prospects of infinite computation could translate into subjective immortality for simulated life forms. Cosmologist Frank Tipler has built on this idea to speculate that you could also achieve subjective immortality in the final moments before a Big Crunch by speeding up the computations toward infinity as the temperature and density skyrocketed. 

So if life engulfs our cosmos, what form will it choose: simple and fast, or complex and slow? I predict that it will make the same choice as Earth life has made: both! The denizens of Earth’s biosphere span a staggering range of sizes, from gargantuan two-hundred-ton blue whales down to the petite 10-16 kg bacterium Pelagibacter, believed to account for more biomass than all the world’s fish combined. Moreover, organisms that are large, complex and slow often mitigate their sluggishness by containing smaller modules that are simple and fast. For example, your blink reflex is extremely fast precisely because it’s implemented by a small and simple circuit that doesn’t involve most of your brain: if that hard-to-swat fly accidentally heads toward your eye, you’ll blink within a tenth of a second, long before the relevant information has had time to spread throughout your brain and make you consciously aware of what happened. By organizing its information processing into a hierarchy of modules, our biosphere manages to both have the cake and eat it, attaining both speed and complexity. We humans already use this same hierarchical strategy to optimize parallel computing. 

What, if any, of this future information processing will be conscious in the sense of involving a subjective experience is a controversial and fascinating topic which we’ll explore in chapter 8. If consciousness requires the different parts of the system to be able to communicate with one another, then the thoughts of larger systems are by necessity slower. Whereas you or a future Earth-sized supercomputer can have many thoughts per second, a galaxy-sized mind could have only one thought every hundred thousand years, and a cosmic mind a billion light-years in size would only have time to have about ten thoughts in total before dark energy fragmented it into disconnected parts. On the other hand, these few precious thoughts and accompanying experiences might be quite deep! 

However, if superintelligence develops technology that can readily rearrange elementary particles into any form of matter whatsoever, then it will eliminate most of the incentive for long-distance trade. Why bother shipping silver between distant solar systems when it’s simpler and quicker to transmute copper into silver by rearranging its particles? Why bother shipping high-tech machinery between galaxies when both the know-how and the raw materials (any matter will do) exist in both places? My guess is that in a cosmos teeming with superintelligence, almost the only commodity worth shipping long distances will be information. The only exception might be matter to be used for cosmic engineering projects—for example, to counteract the aforementioned destructive tendency of dark energy to tear civilizations apart. As opposed to traditional human trade, this matter can be shipped in any convenient bulk form whatsoever, perhaps even as an energy beam, since the receiving superintelligence can rapidly rearrange it into whatever objects it wants. 

If the distance between neighboring space-settling civilizations is much larger than dark energy lets them expand, then they’ll never come into contact with each other or even find out about each other’s existence, so they’ll feel as if they’re alone in the cosmos. If our cosmos is more fecund so that neighbors are closer together, however, some civilizations will eventually overlap. What happens in these overlap regions? Will there be cooperation, competition or war?
